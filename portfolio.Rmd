# Analyzing score data set of a color game

## Background

Playing video games was one of the hobbies I grew up doing and loving. Playing video games can give you some enjoyment while challenging your skills. In this analysis I try to answer some questions that might show some behavior difference between gamers and non-gamers 


**My PS4 console**

## Introduction

Color game is a game where you have to pick the right color within the time limit.
There are two modes of the game.

**Normal mode**

The game will ask you to choose a color from 4 options within 3 seconds. The default number of questions is 20. It can be changed but in this case we stuck to 20 question per person

**Example :** <span style='color:white;background:red;padding:2px;'>red</span>

**Shuffled colors mode**
The game will ask you to choose a word from 4 options where colors and words are shuffled .

**Example :** <span style='color:white;background:green;padding:2px;'>red</span>

The default number of questions is 20. It can be changed but in this case we stuck to 20 question per person.

You can play the game on this [link](https://yousef-aldawoud.github.io/color-game/)

### Dataset 

The data set collected shows the scores of the games played twice in both modes.
It also show you the age, gender, and if the person is a gamer (plays video-games casually)
The dataset is assigned IDs to keep the names anonymous.

**Reading dataset**

```{r data_read, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
game_data = read.csv('data.csv');
kable(head(game_data));
```

#### Attributes

**ID**: a sudo id for the users to keep them anonymous.

**First time** : How much the player scored in the first try (normal mode).

**Second time** : How much the player scored in the second try (normal mode).

**First time with shuffle** : How much the player scored in the second try (shuffled mode).

**Second time with shuffle** : How much the player scored in the second try (shuffled mode).

**Gamer** : plays video games casually.

**Age** : player's age.

**Gender** : player's gender (m for male, f for female).





#### Data summary

```{r data_summary, echo=TRUE}
kable(summary(game_data));
```

The observations are as follows:

There are `17` observations. 
9 males 8 females and 9 gamers (people who casually play games) and 8 people who don't play games.


## First score in the game:

In the data set we have many people who scored high scores from the start such as 20 and 19. Given it is their first time playing the game
Which made me question whether all players are going to score the more in the second try than the first try

My null hypothesis is that the number of scores in the second try is less than the first try

```{r t_test, echo=TRUE}
observed_first_score <-game_data$first.time;
observed_second_score <-game_data$second.time;
boxplot(observed_first_score,observed_second_score, names = c('first time','second time'));
pValue = t.test(observed_first_score,observed_second_score, alternative = "less")$p.value;
cat("p-value = ",pValue)
```

We fail to reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is more than 0.05


## Casual gamers 

One of the questions I asked people before starting the game is whether they usually play video games as a hobby. 
Video games being one of the hobbies that I enjoy I always hear that there are more male players than female players.
Which I wanted to see whether this is a true statement or just a false stereotype.
My null hypothesis is that there being a casual gamer is independent from the gender variable.

```{r fisher_test,echo=TRUE}
contingencyTable = table(game_data$gender,game_data$Gamer);
kable(contingencyTable);
fisher.test(contingencyTable)
```

since the p-value is less that 0.05 we can reject the null hypothesis. It seems that that most gamers are males.


## Game Score with shuffling

When playing the game with the shuffled mode most players started scoring less that they used too.
I had players take two rounds on the shuffled colors mode. I wanted to know whether people will usually score more.

**Plotting the data** 

```{r lm_plot,echo=TRUE}
linear_reg_mode = lm(game_data$first.time.with.shuffle~game_data$second.time.with.shuffle,game_data);
plot(game_data$first.time.with.shuffle~game_data$second.time.with.shuffle,game_data);
abline(linear_reg_mode)
```

The null Hypothesis is that the coefficients associated with both scores is equal to zero.

```{r lm_r,echo=TRUE}
summary(linear_reg_mode)
```

Since the p-value is less than 0.05 which means we can reject the null hypothesis. Meaning that the score in the first round will effect the score in the second round and people are more likely to score more in the second round in the shuffled mode

## Age

One of the questions I asked people after finishing their game is their age. I collected this data to see if the age of a person effects the score.
The null hypothesis is that the coefficients associated with Age and Score points

**Plotting data**


```{r lm_age_plot,echo=TRUE}
linear_reg_mode_age = lm(game_data$first.time~game_data$Age);
plot(game_data$first.time~game_data$Age);
abline(linear_reg_mode_age)
```

We can see in the plotted data points that there are many gaps in the age. Which might affect our test.
The null Hypothesis is that the coefficients associated with both scores is equal to zero.

```{r lm_r2,echo=TRUE}
summary(linear_reg_mode_age)
```

Since the p-value is more than 0.05 we fail to reject the null hypothesis. We need more data to test our hypothesis.


## Game score

Since the data set has the score for both levels I wanted to check whether the shuffled mode had greater score than the normal mode

My null hypothesis is that the score in the shuffled mode is greater than the data in the normal mode

```{r d,echo=TRUE}
boxplot(game_data$first.time,game_data$first.time.with.shuffle)
t.test(game_data$first.time,game_data$first.time.with.shuffle, alternative = "greater")
```

Since the p-value is more than 0.05 we fail to reject the null hypthises. We might need more data to achieve to test our hypothesis.


## Conclusion

The data set seems to provide some valuable results, We test whether the second play score will be greater than first play score which we failed to test since the p-value is more than 0.05.
We also tested weather the number of male gamers are more than female gamers which is true most players are males since our fisher.test had a p-value less than 0.05.
When looking at the relation between the first round and the second round in the shuffled mode scores we notice that people usually score more in the second.
When using the age to create a linear regression model it didn't work properly due to gaps in the age data.
When comparing the first round and the first round we had not enough evidence to support our claim that people will score more in the round with shuffled colors

Looking at the data set we learned some truth, however if we had more records to analyze it will provide more valuable information
